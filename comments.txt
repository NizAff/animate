Hey! what is up guys?
Today I'm gonna give a simple example of how you can add 
smooth scroll or smooth transition to your page using one single 
line in CSS.
The reason why I'm doing this video, is because I see lot of people
messing with javascript to add this simple thing to their website.
Well, in some cases you need some javascript to do it, for example 
if you want to customize the speed or easing in or out or maybe
both. Or even if you wanted a kinda tilted way so you're gonna 
need to deal with x and y axis and that kind of stuff.

Ok let's see what we got in here. So I have this minimal page 
filled with some text and a fixed navbar to navigate throughout
the sections. You can see that whenever I click on a link it takes me
down to it or up if it's on top of the current section.

Alright, let's take a look at how we can do it. So I have this html
file which has 4 divs and a navbar. Each div has an ID and each
link in the ul has an empty url. So the way we jump from a section
to another is by assigning the section's ID as url to the a tag.
We just need to type # and then the ID. and that's it.
let's see if it works. there we go. But you can see that it doesn't 
have the smooth scroll effect. To do that, I'm just gonna go ahead 
to my css file and type: html{ scroll-behavior: smooth;}.
Hit save, and it works.

Ok that's it guys. I didn't start from scratch cause you know all 
the markup and styling are just basic stuff you can see that we 
have nothing special nothing advanced. It's crystal clear just 
simple stuff. I'll add a codepen demo in the description in case
you need it. Ok thanks for watching and see you later.

Although, we've never met.
